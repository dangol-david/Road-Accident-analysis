According to WHO, every year the lives of approximately 1.3 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury.

Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.

In this project, we will be analyzing data related to road accidents, which can be utilized to study accident-prone conditions and also helps understand the factors that influence road fatalities.

The dataset can be found here.

The Data
The dataset covers all traffic accidents in 2021 and 2022 and contains over 307,000 records. The data contains a wide range of information from date of the accident, severity of the accident, light conditions, road surface conditions, road type, type of vehicle and number of casualties.
